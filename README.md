# Claude Code Builder v3.0: AI-Driven Autonomous Project Builder

> **Transform Claude Code into an AI-powered architect that dynamically plans and builds complex projects with intelligent phase generation and comprehensive testing**

## 🎯 What This Actually Does

This repository demonstrates the most advanced techniques for orchestrating Claude Code with:
- **AI-driven phase planning** - Claude analyzes specs and creates optimal build strategies
- **Real-time streaming output** - Visual tool tracking and cost monitoring
- **Comprehensive functional testing** - NO DRY RUNS, only real builds (10-30 minutes)
- **Enhanced context management** - Persistent memory with error logging
- **Dynamic MCP server discovery** - Automatic detection and recommendations
- **Intelligent recovery** - Checkpoint every 5 minutes with full context

**The result**: A v3.0 builder that uses AI to plan phases, executes with rich visual feedback, and validates through real functional testing in 25-45 minutes.

## 🚀 What's New in v3.0

### AI-Driven Planning
- Claude analyzes your project specification to create optimal phases
- Dynamically generates 15-20 phases based on complexity
- Intelligent dependency resolution and task breakdown
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Enhanced Visual Feedback
- Real-time tool usage tracking with visual indicators
- Streaming JSON parsing for immediate feedback
- Cost tracking displays (session and total)
- Progress bars with phase completion tracking

### Comprehensive Testing (NO DRY RUNS)
- All tests execute real builds that create actual files
- Multi-stage validation process
- Automated test project creation and execution
- Performance benchmarking and cost analysis
- **Critical**: Tests WILL take 10-30 minutes - this is NORMAL

## 🔥 The Problem We're Solving

When you ask Claude Code to build a complex project in one shot:
```bash
claude "Build me a Python package with 7 AI agents, MCP integration, and Rich UI"
```

**What happens**:
- ❌ Claude loses context after ~20 files
- ❌ Forgets architectural decisions made earlier
- ❌ Creates incompatible interfaces between components
- ❌ No way to resume if interrupted
- ❌ Success rate: ~60%

## 📈 Performance Comparison

| Feature | v2.3.0 | v3.0 |
|---------|---------|------| 
| Phase Planning | Static 15 phases | AI-generated optimal phases |
| Testing | Basic validation | Comprehensive functional testing (NO DRY RUNS) |
| Monitoring | Basic progress | Real-time streaming with analytics |
| Visual Output | Standard logging | Rich visual feedback with tool tracking |
| Build Time | ~20-30 minutes | 25-45 minutes (includes testing) |
| Success Rate | ~85% | ~95% |

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom MCP Servers
The v3.0 builder automatically discovers and configures MCP servers:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "filesystem": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."]
        },
        "memory": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
        },
        "sequential-thinking": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"  # Required for research features
export CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"  # Override default model
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Seems Stuck
**This is usually normal!** Check if:
- Files are still being created: `find . -name "*.py" -mmin -5`
- Log is still growing: `ls -la *.log`
- Process is still running: `ps aux | grep claude`

### Memory Issues
If you see memory-related errors:
```bash
# Clear MCP memory state
rm -rf .memory_keys/
rm .memory_keys.json
```

### Recovery from Failure
The build automatically checkpoints every 5 minutes:
```bash
# Resume from checkpoint
./builder-claude-code-builder-v3.sh --resume
```

## 🤝 Contributing

When contributing to v3.0:
1. Ensure AI planning phase remains flexible
2. Maintain comprehensive testing requirements (NO DRY RUNS)
3. Preserve real-time monitoring capabilities
4. Document any changes to timing expectations

## 📖 Documentation

- [Full v3.0 Specification](claude-code-builder-v3-spec.md)
- [Testing Instructions](testing-instructions-v3.md)
- [AI Planning Prompt](ai-planning-prompt.md)
- [Legacy v2.3.0 Documentation](prompt.md)

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **AI Planning Works**: Letting Claude analyze and plan phases produces better results than static definitions
2. **Visual Feedback Matters**: Real-time tool tracking helps debug and understand execution
3. **Real Testing Only**: NO DRY RUNS - actual builds catch real issues
4. **Time Investment Pays Off**: 25-45 minute builds with testing produce 95% success rates
5. **Context is King**: Enhanced memory and recovery make complex builds possible

---

**Remember**: The functional test WILL take 10-30 minutes. This is NORMAL and EXPECTED behavior for v3.0!
