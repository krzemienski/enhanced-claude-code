# Build Strategy v3.0

## Memory Integration Strategy
- Initialize mem0 storage at project start
- Store all architectural decisions with rationale
- Cache library documentation in context7
- Track all tool usage patterns
- Log performance metrics and optimizations

## Research Integration
- Implement research workflow per CLAUDE.md
- Use context7 for all library documentation
- Store research findings for cross-project use
- Log all research activities with outcomes

## Tool Usage
- Log every tool invocation with purpose
- Track tool performance metrics
- Store successful patterns in mem0
- Monitor API limits and usage

## Production Standards
- No mock implementations
- Integration tests only
- Real API testing
- Production rate limiting
- Cloud-ready deployment

## Security Implementation
- Environment variables for config
- Input validation everywhere
- Proper SSL/TLS usage
- Credential rotation support
- Security audit logging

## Error Management
- Comprehensive error tracking
- Automatic retries with backoff
- Circuit breaker implementation
- Clear operator messaging
- Error pattern storage in mem0

## Performance Strategy
- Batch operations by default
- Connection pooling
- Response time monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Performance pattern storage

## Documentation Approach
- Automated documentation generation
- Clear operational procedures
- API documentation with examples
- Configuration guides
- Troubleshooting procedures
