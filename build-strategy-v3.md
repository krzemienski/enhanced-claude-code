## Critical Path Analysis

### Primary Critical Path (25 minutes)
1. Foundation → Models → AI Planning → Execution → Testing → Final Integration

### Secondary Paths (Parallel)
- Research System (can begin after SDK integration)
- MCP Discovery (independent after models)
- UI Development (can start with monitoring)

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **AI Planning System (Phase 3)**
   - Risk: Complex logic for dynamic phase generation
   - Mitigation: Extensive validation, fallback templates
   - Recovery: Pre-defined phase templates if AI fails

2. **Execution System (Phase 8)**
   - Risk: Integration complexity with multiple components
   - Mitigation: Modular design, comprehensive error handling
   - Recovery: Checkpoint system every 5 minutes

3. **Functional Testing (Phase 11)**
   - Risk: External dependencies and runtime errors
   - Mitigation: Isolated test environments, timeout management
   - Recovery: Partial test results, skip non-critical tests

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **Research Agents (Phase 6)**
   - Risk: API rate limits and network issues
   - Mitigation: Retry logic, caching, fallback data

2. **Real-time Monitoring (Phase 9)**
   - Risk: Performance overhead
   - Mitigation: Efficient streaming, buffering

### Low-Risk Areas

1. **Foundation and Models (Phases 1-2)**
   - Well-defined structure, minimal external dependencies

2. **Documentation (Phase 16)**
   - Static content generation, low complexity

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Throughout Development)
- Each module tested independently
- Mock external dependencies
- Target 80% code coverage

### Integration Testing (Phase Boundaries)
- Test component interactions
- Validate data flow between phases
- Ensure API contracts are met

### Functional Testing (Phase 18)

#### Stage 1: Installation Verification
```bash
pip install -e .
claude-code-builder --version
# Expected: Version 3.0.0
```

#### Stage 2: CLI Functionality
```bash
claude-code-builder --help
claude-code-builder analyze spec.md
claude-code-builder plan spec.md --output plan.json
```

#### Stage 3: Example Project Execution
```bash
# Simple API project (10 minutes)
claude-code-builder examples/simple_api.md --output ./test-simple-api

# Complex web app (20 minutes)
claude-code-builder examples/web_app.md --output ./test-web-app

# CLI tool project (15 minutes)
claude-code-builder examples/cli_tool.md --output ./test-cli-tool
```

#### Stage 4: Performance Benchmarking
- Measure execution time per phase
- Track memory usage
- Monitor API call counts
- Calculate total costs

#### Stage 5: Error Recovery Testing
```bash
# Start build
claude-code-builder examples/web_app.md --output ./test-recovery

# Interrupt after 10 minutes (Ctrl+C)
# Resume from checkpoint
claude-code-builder --resume ./test-recovery/.claude-state.json
```

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with concurrent builds
- Memory leak detection
- Resource usage profiling

## Checkpoint Strategy

### Phase-Level Checkpoints
- Save state after each phase completion
- Include context, memory, and progress
- Enable resumption from any phase

### Time-Based Checkpoints
- Auto-save every 5 minutes
- Minimal performance impact
- Compressed state storage

### Recovery Process
1. Load last checkpoint
2. Reconstruct context
3. Verify phase integrity
4. Resume execution
5. Skip completed tasks

## Cost Optimization

### Estimated Costs by Category
- Claude Code SDK calls: $2-3
- Research API calls: $0.50-1
- AI Planning calls: $0.50
- Testing execution: $1
- **Total per build: $4-5.50**

### Optimization Strategies
- Cache research results
- Reuse planning for similar projects
- Batch API calls where possible
- Skip optional features on budget builds

## Implementation Notes

### Phase Execution Order
1. **Sequential Requirements**: Phases 1→2→3 must run in order
2. **Parallel Opportunities**: Phases 4,5,6,7 can run concurrently
3. **Integration Points**: Phase 8 requires 3-7 complete
4. **Final Assembly**: Phases 15-18 must be sequential

### Critical Success Factors
1. **AI Planning Quality**: The AI must generate optimal phases
2. **Error Recovery**: Robust checkpoint and resume system
3. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive functional testing
4. **Performance**: Meet time and resource targets

### Monitoring During Build
- Real-time progress bars
- Cost accumulation display
- Error rate tracking
- ETA updates
- Resource usage graphs
