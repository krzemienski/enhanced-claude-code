   - Phase-level recovery
   - Context reconstruction
   - Automatic retry strategies

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 0: AI Planning Phase
Claude will analyze the specification and create:
- Optimal phase breakdown (likely 15-20 phases)
- Detailed task lists per phase
- Dependency graph
- Risk assessment
- Testing strategy

### Dynamic Phases (AI-Generated)
The AI will determine the best phases, but typically includes:
- Foundation and setup
- Core models and structures
- API integrations
- Business logic
- UI/UX implementation
- Testing framework
- Documentation
- Optimization
- Deployment preparation

### Final Phase: Comprehensive Testing
1. **Installation Test**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   claude-code-builder --version
   ```

2. **CLI Test**
   ```bash
   claude-code-builder --help
   claude-code-builder example.md --dry-run
   ```

3. **Functional Test**
   ```bash
   # Create test project
   claude-code-builder examples/simple-api.md --output-dir ./test-output
   
   # Monitor execution (up to 30 minutes)
   # Check for errors, validate output
   # Verify all files created
   ```

4. **Performance Test**
   - Measure execution time
   - Track memory usage
   - Monitor API calls
   - Calculate total cost

5. **Recovery Test**
   - Interrupt and resume
   - Corrupt state and recover
   - Network failure simulation

## Success Criteria
