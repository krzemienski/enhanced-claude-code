- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (cost tracking)
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 (research integration)
- Phase 7 depends on Phase 6 (context management)
- Phase 8 requires all phases complete

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Tasks:
1. **AI Synthesis Implementation** (Phase 2)
   - Mitigation: Have fallback to basic synthesis
   
2. **Performance Metrics Collection** (Phase 3)
   - Mitigation: Make it toggleable
   
3. **Backward Compatibility** (Phase 1)
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing with old data

### Medium Risk Tasks:
1. **Regex Pattern Matching** (Phase 5)
   - Mitigation: Strict input validation
   
2. **Context Accumulation** (Phase 7)
   - Mitigation: Size limits and cleanup

## Total Implementation Estimate

**Total Tasks**: 89
**Estimated Time**: 
- Solo implementation: 80-120 hours
- With interruptions: 100-150 hours
- As Claude Code: 15-25 sessions

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Complete Phase 1 first (critical for cost visibility)
2. Run Phases 4 & 5 in parallel with Phase 2
3. Complete remaining phases sequentially
4. Dedicate significant time to Phase 8 integration
