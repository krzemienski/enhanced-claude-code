# AI Planning Phase - Claude Code Builder v3.0

You are about to plan the optimal build strategy for Claude Code Builder v3.0. This is a critical phase where you must:

1. **ANALYZE THE SPECIFICATION**
   - Read the full v3.0 specification
   - Identify all major components and their relationships
   - Map out technical dependencies
   - Assess complexity and risks

2. **CREATE OPTIMAL PHASE PLAN**
   
   Design 15-20 phases that:
   - Follow logical dependency order
   - Group related functionality
   - Enable parallel work where possible
   - Include validation checkpoints
   - Account for v3.0 enhancements

   Each phase should have:
   - Clear objective
   - Specific deliverables
   - Success criteria
   - Estimated complexity (1-5)
   - Dependencies on other phases

3. **GENERATE DETAILED TASKS**
   
   For each phase, create 5-15 specific tasks that:
   - Are concrete and actionable
   - Include file paths and function names
   - Specify exact functionality to implement
   - Reference v3.0 features explicitly
   - Include test requirements

4. **DESIGN TESTING STRATEGY**
   
   Create a comprehensive testing plan that includes:
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests for phase boundaries
   - Functional tests for user scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Error recovery tests

5. **RISK ASSESSMENT**
   
   Identify potential risks:
   - Technical challenges
   - Integration complexities
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Testing difficulties
   - Recovery scenarios

6. **OUTPUT FORMAT**

   Create two files using filesystem__write_file:
   
   a) `build-phases-v3.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "3.0.0",
     "total_phases": 18,
     "phases": [
       {
         "number": 1,
         "name": "Foundation and Architecture",
         "objective": "...",
         "deliverables": [...],
         "tasks": [...],
         "complexity": 3,
         "dependencies": [],
         "estimated_time": "5-8 minutes"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   
   b) `build-strategy-v3.md`:
   - Executive summary
   - Phase dependency graph
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Testing approach
   - Success metrics

Remember:
- This planning will determine the entire build strategy
- Consider all v3.0 enhancements
- Plan for comprehensive functional testing
- Account for real-world execution times (25-45 minutes total)
- Include error recovery and checkpoint strategies

Take your time to create a thorough, well-thought-out plan.
